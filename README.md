Very Effective Altruism is a decentralised application where users can make traceable donations to top charities of their choice. Using social tokens, DAO and NFTs we aim to build a voracious community and give special perks as incentives.

## The Problem

Why should you care?

<!-- Catch their attention (I don't... work to give), because I'm a... but hang on... how does that work? shrug emoji -->

Effective altruism is set up to focus on giving in a way that, unfortunately, undermines its own effectiveness. This is coupled with issues around charity donation tracebility.

Additionally, the Centre for Effective Altruism has identified these mistakes:

<!-- This friction needs to be real, sizable and recurring -->

| Problems      | How tokenisation can help |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Running too many projects      | DAO       |
| Executive turnover and limited board oversight    | DAO        |
| Causes not representative of the whole community | DAO |
| Failure to deliver an EA groups platform | DAO |
| Poor grant administration and record keeping | Blockchain and Smart Contracts |
| Outdated fund balances | Blockchain |
| Mixed messages and unclear communication about the Pledge | NFT |

## The Solution

We reward users who pledge to give a percentage of their income to worthwhile charities with social tokens.

We reward our community of Effective Altruists. Giving them incentives to meet their pledge in the form of some NFT.

By virtue of owning one of these NFTs you will be granted partner benefits such as discounted stadium tickets, access to podcasts.


## NFTs are not just for monkeys!

In 2021, Twitter allowed their users to show off their verified NFT

#### We're incentivising the wrong behaviour

Imagine a world where instead of rewarding conspicuous consumption, we reward the people who do the most good in society?


## How does it work?

<!-- Rich Picture, edit twitter verification image -->

1. Users make a pledge to donate % of their income annually. In return they get a Level 1 NFT
1. They interact with a smart contract when they donate, if they meet the requirements they get a Level 2 NFT (depending on how much they donate).
1. Their NFT will expire (not be owned by them) after a year so they need to donate again.
1. These NFTs act as a social token (or a badge that they own).
1. Partnering with other companies we will get the users unique perks.
1. A Dao is also available for NFT owners to vote for the top 10 charity list.
